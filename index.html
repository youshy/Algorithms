      Literally almost no styling because that's not the goal of this
      repository. I just want to have nice hub with all algorithms. Why do I do
      that? Because I'm working on my 'Big O" notation knowledge and I want to
      check how it works in live environment.
    </p>

      Oh, and of course - the goal is to write everything using ES6. Not OO
      because I don't feel like I need it here and there's no need to be posh
      and fancy when you don't have to be, right?
